									<p><span style="font-size: 1.5em; font-style: Italic">B</span>orn into a family of
										assassins in the shadow of Bleachbone Keep and set upon a dark path of revenge by
										the treachery of neighboring warlords, the pale lad known as Nigel Untzalot
										eventually found his bitter victory atop a windswept hill in the wild Under regions.
										Standing tall among the stacked corpses of his enemies, Nigel gazed upon the blood
										matting their long fuzzy ears, pink noses, and puffball tails. He felt no joy then,
										only the singular thud of his youth's gates as they closed within him. His father's
										blade felt heavy in his grip, and without emotion he let it fall to the crushed
										grass. Never again would he hear its song as it whistled through the air. There were
										more powerful weapons to be mastered. The oracle had spoken of a form of war magic,
										an immense sorcery that made the very air wail, ground pulse, breast tighten, and
										soul shiver. Nigel's thoughts hearkened back to the withered sage's cackle, wheezing
										through dusty lips as one last warning was bestowed. "Hand, head, and heart, young
										Untzalot! Each plays its part in the Dragon's Art, and mind you never let one
										wither! Hand, head, and heart!" Nigel glanced up into the night's eternity and
										patted the precious black-wrapped crate slung at his side, which his travels had
										already filled with a modest supply of mystical ingredients. If the old fraud spoke
										truly, and Nigel indeed meant to learn the ways of the Draco Jinni, then he was
										going to need a bigger crate.</p>
